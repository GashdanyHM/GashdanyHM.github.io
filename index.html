                </div>
                <p>Living in a busy, fast-growing environment with information flying by swiftly, it has become more difficult to focus and explore our inner self. Numerous people have numerous times when they feel empty, useless, depressed. Some may seek company of those who accept and welcome them when they are at their most miserable place. Object Head: W could be someone like that. An object head is a combination of a human-like body with an inanimate object for a head, giving a "soul" to something that wasn't alive in "reality". Creating through a surreal atmosphere, emotions and personality may be conveyed through the object itself while the needed ones can find salvation through connecting souls with them.</p>
                <p>Project Object Head: W is an object head inspired from waves crashing on to the beach. The come and go of ocean waves interacts with whoever is watching at it, as if a friend is calming and playing with them. The letter "W" is just a symbol for this object head design, it could be a representation of "water" "waves" "wooo~" or any names/words the audience can resonate the most. </p>
                <p>To those who enjoys ocean thematic representation, abstraction, and who may wants accompany of a friend..</p>

                <p>As our environment continues to deteriorate due to human behavior, we strive to create an installation which resonates specifically with our community on the coast. Marine ecosystems fall victim to pollution, destructive fishing practices, coastal development, and climate change, all of which contribute to reef degradation. These activities disrupt the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem leading to coral bleaching, algal overgrowth, and habitat loss.</p>
                <p>In this project, the moon silently attempts to communicate with us by illuminating not just the surface beauty we admire, but also the urgency of what lies beneath. When the moon hangs up high, the ocean silently accepts the gentle moonlight. But the cries of reefs, seagulls, whales, and all other ocean creatures can’t be unheard; the more awful scents of brine can’t be unsmelled; the muddy color of seawater and the fading color of the corals can’t be unseen… This information is delivered through the 4 senses: sight, hearing, smell, and touch, raising environmental awareness through a strong contrast between the healthy and the unwell, what stays constant and what varies.</p>
                <p>The Moon Illuminates What the Reef Remembers invites viewers into an intimate exchange between celestial constancy and terrestrial fragility. In this installation, the moon’s steady glow reveals the reef as a living archive and an ecosystem that remembers the suffering it has undergone due to modern human activity. Every tide, pulled by the moon’s gravitational force, uncovers and conceals layers of life and loss hidden beneath the water’s surface.</p>

                <p>Someday is a 2D surrealist narrative game, in which the player can control a normal being and choose how they want to unfold a day and achieve different endings. Player will be free to explore different places (store, school, street, Space, park) in the world and interact with NPCs (store's staff, NPC on street) and bizarre objects to uncover countless endings (achievements system will be implemented to show the unlocked/locked endings). At the end of the day, no matter what ending the player achieved, they will always be back to bed and wake up to a new day.</p>
                <p>Was it a dream? Does my action matter at all to the world? How do I feel after playing this game? Why did I even click in here? Do I continue to play? What should I do next?</p>
                <p>Many questions may arise as the player proceed. It is completely up to the player how they want to interpret the game - or even question its "game" identity. As the developer of this "thing", my goal is to make the player think that the maker of this game/narrative/whatever-we-want-to-call-it must have eaten too many toadstool (poisonous mushroom) so that they produced this.</p>
