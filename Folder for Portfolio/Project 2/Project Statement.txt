The Moon Illuminates what the Reef Remembers

As our environment continues to deteriorate due to human behavior, we strive to create an installation which resonates specifically with our community on the coast. Marine ecosystems fall victim to pollution, destructive fishing practices, coastal development, and climate change, all of which contribute to reef degradation. These activities disrupt the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem leading to coral bleaching, algal overgrowth, and habitat loss.

In this project, the moon silently attempts to communicate with us by illuminating not just the surface beauty we admire, but also the urgency of what lies beneath. When the moon hangs up high, the ocean silently accepts the gentle moonlight. But the cries of reefs, seagulls, whales, and all other ocean creatures can’t be unheard; the more awful scents of brine can’t be unsmelled; the muddy color of seawater and the fading color of the corals can’t be unseen… This information is delivered through the 4 senses: sight, hearing, smell, and touch, raising environmental awareness through a strong contrast between the healthy and the unwell, what stays constant and what varies.

The Moon Illuminates What the Reef Remembers invites viewers into an intimate exchange between celestial constancy and terrestrial fragility. In this installation, the moon’s steady glow reveals the reef as a living archive and an ecosystem that remembers the suffering it has undergone due to modern human activity. Every tide, pulled by the moon’s gravitational force, uncovers and conceals layers of life and loss hidden beneath the water’s surface.
